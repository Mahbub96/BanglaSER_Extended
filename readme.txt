# BanglaSER Extended
BanglaSER Extended is an enhanced version of the original BanglaSER dataset, now expanded to include fear and disgust as new emotion classes. With these additions, the dataset provides a comprehensive collection of audio files for emotion classification in Bengali speech.
The extended dataset builds upon the original emotion classes of happy, sad, angry, neutral, and surprised, offering a broader and more nuanced understanding of emotions expressed in Bengali.
